##This Website is a Demonstration of online editing

This is currently being edited with the Sublime Text editor on a local machine. Once I sync with Github and get Prose to process the markdown, it will be available as a web page on Github Pages.

**Note** that Prose can also be set up to run on our own servers, and to publish output html to a webserver other than Github Pages.
